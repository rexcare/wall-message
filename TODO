// CACH DRIVER (redis driver)
	X add and update docstrings


// DB DRIVER (mysql driver)
	- add and update docstrings
	- transactions
	- type checking, type consistency


// BASE DATA OBJECT
	- add and update docstrings
	- transactions:
		- two or more dataobjects saves with all or nothing commits to database
		- implemented at database driver level?
		- think about interface
		- need rollbacks?
	- think about data type consistency and enforcement
	- asses types of caching currently implemented and research alternatives
	- think about db replication schemes (master->slave vs master->master)
	- think about data consistency problems (in-memory, cache, master, slave)
