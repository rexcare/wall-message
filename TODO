// CACH DRIVER (redis driver)
	X batch sets
	X batch gets
	X batch deletes


// DB DRIVER (mysql driver)
	X more options for query conditionals (where clauses)
	X methods for select, update, and delete by primary key id
	X rewrite testMysqlDriver.py
	X more thorough testing of where conditions
	X switch to UUIDs
	X update interface to use UUIDs
	X update test script
	- transactions? (not at this time)
	- type checking, type consistency? (not at this time)


// BASE DATA OBJECT
	X batch query and batch caching of query result items
	- asses types of caching currently implemented and research alternatives
	- think about db replication schemes (master->slave vs master->master)
	- think about data consistency problems (in-memory, cache, master, slave)
	V think about data type consistency and enforcement
	X switch from auto-incremented ids to UUIDs (better for application)
	V think about db transactions
	X 'created' and 'updated' should remain in the mysql driver. 'uuid' should
		be in the base_data_object.
	X 'created' and 'updated' should be set as metadata attributes in the
		base_data_object instance state
