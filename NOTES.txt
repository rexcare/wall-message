// Backend architecture layers
- route registry (central routing registry)
- api (client endpoints, call into model layer, format response)
- model (operate on data objects, business logic)
- data object (stateful models, represent deserialized records, implements CRUD)
- datastore driver (intermediary interface between application and datastore)
