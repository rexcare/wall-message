TODO:

X get Flask container working
X figure out where to put frontend files
X serve Vue SPA index with Flask
X serve static files with Flask
X add node_modules to docker image
X figure out dev mode and prod mode for backend and frontend
- get docker dev mode process to update files on save or script run

NOTES:

- confirmed that Flask development server does reflect file changes without
	restart
- confirmed webpack-dev-server does hot reload on file change
